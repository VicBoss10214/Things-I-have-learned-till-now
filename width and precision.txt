Width and Precision
Width (x): Specifies the minimum number of characters to be printed. If the value to be printed is shorter than this width, it will be padded with spaces (or zeros if the 0 flag is used).
Precision (y): For floating-point numbers, it specifies the number of digits to be printed after the decimal point. For strings, it specifies the maximum number of characters to be printed.
Examples
Floating-Point Numbers:
printf("%8.2f", 123.456); // Output: "  123.46"

8 is the width, ensuring at least 8 characters are printed.
.2 is the precision, ensuring 2 digits after the decimal point.
Strings:
printf("%.5s", "Hello, World!"); // Output: "Hello"

.5 specifies that only the first 5 characters of the string are printed.
Integers:
printf("%5d", 42); // Output: "   42"

5 is the width, ensuring at least 5 characters are printed, with spaces padding the left.
Combining Width and Precision
You can combine width and precision to format the output precisely:

printf("%10.4f", 3.1415926535); // Output: "    3.1416"

10 is the width, ensuring at least 10 characters are printed.
.4 is the precision, ensuring 4 digits after the decimal point.
Example Program
Hereâ€™s a simple program demonstrating these concepts:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float num = 123.456;
    printf("Width 10, Precision 2: %10.2f\n", num);
    printf("Width 8, Precision 3: %8.3f\n", num);
    printf("Width 6, Precision 1: %6.1f\n", num);
    return 0;
}

This program will output:

Width 10, Precision 2:     123.46
Width 8, Precision 3:  123.456
Width 6, Precision 1:  123.5
